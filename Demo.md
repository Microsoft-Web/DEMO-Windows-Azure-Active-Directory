## Overview ##

1.       File / New / Configure WAAD in a new project
2.       Jazz hands and say “we’ve merged those files and packages into our existing app, here’s what it looks like”
3.       Deploy or show portal configuration in an already deployed site
 
So this would have a start state that has GeekQuiz with the WAAD stuff from a new MVC application using WAAD already merged in. I don’t know if there would even be an end state, since that would be pretty much ready to run.
